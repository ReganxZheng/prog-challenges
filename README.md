# prog-challenges
A collection of my own solutions to various programming challenges from different sources.

Feel free to use any part of these for your own work on any project, or use them as insights to your own solutions for similar problems, but do not submit these as solutions without taking the time to understand them. Otherwise, you'll never learn.
